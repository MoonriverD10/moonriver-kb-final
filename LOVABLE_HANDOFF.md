# Moon River Knowledge Base - Lovable.dev Handoff Kit

**Project Goal:** Build the "Moon River Academy D10 Knowledge Base" — an educational portal for project management students.

## 1. Core Visual Assets (The "Road Map")
We have created a 4-panel isometric "Road Map" that visualizes the entire project lifecycle. Use these images as the centerpiece of the "Student Overview" or "Visual Blueprint" section.

**Asset Links (Raw GitHub URLs):**
*   **Panel 1 (Chapters 1-3):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonriverD10/moonriver-kb-final/main/public/images/pm-workflow-panel-1-roadmap.png`
*   **Panel 2 (Chapters 4-6):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonriverD10/moonriver-kb-final/main/public/images/pm-workflow-panel-2-roadmap-blue.png`
*   **Panel 3 (Chapters 7-9):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonriverD10/moonriver-kb-final/main/public/images/pm-workflow-panel-3-roadmap-blue.png`
*   **Panel 4 (Chapters 10-11):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoonriverD10/moonriver-kb-final/main/public/images/pm-workflow-panel-4-roadmap-blue.png`

**Design Note:** All panels share a consistent "Blue Blueprint Grid" background. They are designed to be displayed sequentially to form a continuous journey.

## 2. Content Structure (The Curriculum)
The application should be structured around these 11 Chapters, grouped into 4 Phases (matching the panels):

### Phase 1: Contract & Setup (Panel 1)
*   **Chapter 1:** Awarded Contract/Purchase Order (Review, Compare to Bid, Scope Review)
*   **Chapter 2:** Execute Contract (Signatures)
*   **Chapter 3:** Start-up Documents (COI, SOV, Misc Docs)

### Phase 2: System Setup & Approvals (Panel 2)
*   **Chapter 4:** System Input (Trello, QuickBooks, Paper Organization)
*   **Chapter 5:** Submittals (Request Quotes, Approve Quotes, Submit Drawings)
*   **Chapter 6:** Release to Production (Approval Received, Lead Times, Drop Ship)

### Phase 3: Installation & Invoicing (Panel 3)
*   **Chapter 7:** Coordinate Install (Installer Quotes, Scheduling)
*   **Chapter 8:** Final Install (Confirm Delivery, Confirm Date, Complete Install)
*   **Chapter 9:** Invoicing (Pay Apps G702/G703, Final Retainage Bill)

### Phase 4: Closeout (Panel 4)
*   **Chapter 10:** Close-Out Docs (Warranties, Lien Waivers, Punch List)
*   **Chapter 11:** Final Payment (Receive Payment, Pay Vendors, Archive Project)

## 3. Design Specifications
*   **Primary Color:** Moon River Blue (`#1e40af` or similar deep blue)
*   **Background Style:** Clean, professional, using the "Blueprint Grid" motif where appropriate.
*   **Typography:** Clean sans-serif (Inter or Roboto) for readability.
*   **Vibe:** Educational, structured, professional, yet engaging ("Gamified" progress tracking is a plus).
