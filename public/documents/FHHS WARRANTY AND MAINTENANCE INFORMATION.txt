## PROXY SIGNS MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS

### Cleaning ADA Interior Signage

The interior ADA signs are constructed with acrylic faces and tactile (Braille) elements.

**Recommended Cleaning Procedure:**
1. **Frequency:** Clean as needed to maintain appearance
2. **Method:** Use a non-abrasive cloth (microfiber towel or lint-free paper towel) with mild soap and water solution
3. **Avoid:** 
   - Do NOT use harsh detergents or chemicals, as this will dull (matte) the finish
   - Do NOT use abrasive cleaners or scrubbing pads
   - Do NOT use solvent-based cleaners

**Additional Notes:**
- Interior signage typically requires less frequent cleaning than exterior products
- Routine cleaning helps maintain the original luster of painted and acrylic surfaces
- Pay special attention to tactile/Braille elements to ensure they remain clean and legible
